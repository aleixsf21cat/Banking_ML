# Banking_ML
In this practical case I want to show you how banks could concede a credit. In this small project we will observe the importance of obtaining complete data, how to preprocess it, how to manage different algorithms/methods, and how to interpret them. Two methods called Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting Classifier will be compared. Each dataset will be different, so we have to fit our solution to each case.  [1] This databased will be based on public data from Spanish Government. Firstly, we should install their required libraries. We will use a program called Python. This small project is inspired in a practical case of the subject "Miner√≠a de datos avanzados" from UOC.
