# Banking_ML

The aim of this report is to outline the importance of managing and comprehending data in real-world projects. In a very short term, it is highly plausible that many AI developments could influence in our day-to-day decisions. Hence, it seems far-fetched that we do not understand how these systems are designed per se. 

In the upcoming future, it could give rise to plenty of hefty challenges. Be that as it may, it could sow the seeds of other cons. To name but a few, inequalities could rise, roles propagation could be perpetuated or social bipolarity could be extended.

Thus, it happens to be significant that we must interpret and understand their applications. My insight is that there are some easy-to-interpret algorithms such as decision trees. Albeit, we must give prominence to the fact that other methods such as Decision Gradient are a black box (they could run smoothly with a great precision. However, there is a setback in its difficult comprehension). Indeed, I dare say that the best way to democratize AI is reviewed it thoroughly.

In this practical case I want to show you how banks could concede a credit. In this small project we will observe the importance of obtaining complete data, how to preprocess it, how to manage different algorithms/methods, and how to interpret them. Two methods called Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting Classifier will be compared. Each dataset will be different, so we have to fit our solution to each case.

[1] This databased will be based on public data from Spanish Government. Firstly, we should install their required libraries. We will use a program called Python. This small project is inspired in a practical case of the subject "Miner√≠a de datos avanzados" from UOC.
